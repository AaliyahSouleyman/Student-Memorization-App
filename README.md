The project was created for a previous professor who struggled to memorize the names and faces of his students. This prototype allows users to play a matching game to connect names and faces of popular figures.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React Native


This project was built using React Native and was my introduction to the framework. Deliverables for this project included figma wireframes and a working prototype. The react-navigation module is used to allow the user to choose between the different sections of the application such as the home screen where my professor can choose a course and section to memorize, a game section where he can actually play the game, an intitial log in screen, and an account section where he can see his account information. UseState was used to keep track of user score to display at the end of each game.


## Lessons Learned:


    * Gained a grasp on the fundamentals of React Native
    * Gained experience working through the user interface design cycle to deliver a product for an actual problem to a real stakeholder.
